    <p>This website uses heuristics to track the movement of the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus
        through the United States of America by drawing on publicly available tagged
        viral genetic sequences and phylogenetic tree constructed by <a href = "https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">UShER.</a>

    <p>The above heatmap by default displays the count of inferred unique families of the virus in each state,
        identified by counting clusters of viral sequences from an area that are closely related and appear 
        to share a single common ancestor that entered the region from outside. 
    </p>
    <p>By clicking on a single state of interest, the display changes to an estimate of genetic flow
        of the virus from other states. This metric is scaled by the total clusters detected in both 
        the state of interest and the putative origin and generally reflects close geographic association, suggesting
        the virus tends to cross interstate borders by land.
